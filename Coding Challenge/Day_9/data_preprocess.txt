For pre-processing, we considered Python as our options for the project . The ML
algorithms provided by the scikit-learn package do not function if the input data has missing
values. Hence we either had to impute data at the missing slots or remove the instances that had
these missing fields. Upon examining the data, we realized that in this project we have some missing values which was replaced by zero. we also observed that dataset have categorical data that needs to be converted in integer
values to make the model work. And to do that we used LabelEncoder().
Additionally, the statistical correlation between some features (for instances where they were
available) were appeared to be not related. Hence, we dropped those features. In addition to
this, sampling was necessary for machine learning algorithms.

Regression Method 

Here,in this project we have used Random forest algorithm as the average score after training was about 94 percent 
which was maximun with respect to other algorithms such as Linear Regression(84 percent), Decision Tree (92 percent aprox).
However as the data is very large and we had many attributes so the training part of the data took verylong time. So we
had trained the data single time only and had saved the trained data in the pickle file, from where we can use that train
data to make the predictions. 

Data Visulaization

visualization of the data we had used matplotlib library.
Through matplotlib,we were able to visualize weekly sales of the each store,weekly sales of 
each department.
